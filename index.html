<h1 id="comsol-manual-3---quantum-mechanics">COMSOL manual 3 - Quantum mechanics</h1>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Solving time-independent Schrodinger equation for simple 1D and 2D system with a well and a harmonic potential.</li>
<li>Solving time-dependent Schrodinger equation and observe tunneling phenomena.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="schrodinger-equation">Schrodinger equation</h2>
<p>We are trying to solve the Schrodinger equation for some simple cases. Schrodinger equation for a single particle wave function,<span class="math inline">\(\psi(\mathbf{r}, t)\)</span> in a potential, <span class="math inline">\(V(\mathbf{r})\)</span> is given as follows. <span class="math display">\[
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi(\mathbf{r}, t) =\hat{H}\psi(\mathbf{r}, t)= \left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r}) \right]\psi(\mathbf{r}, t)
\]</span> In the quantum mechanics lecture, we understand this differential equation with steady state solutions or time-independent Schrodinger equation. We obtain the equation by using an ansatz that gives time independent probability distribution of the particle, <span class="math inline">\(\psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \psi(\mathbf{r})e^{-iEt/\hbar}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is a constant called energy eigenvalue. Inserting to the Schrodinger equation, we get the following. <span class="math display">\[
E\psi(\mathbf{r}) = \left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r}) \right]\psi(\mathbf{r})
\]</span> Depends on the functional form of the potential, one can solve or can not solve the equation by hand. First, we are going to solve this equation with COMSOL for the case we can solve exactly by hand. Then, we extend the potential to some interesting cases. We work with several potentials as a practice.</p>
<h3 id="time-independent-schrodinger-equation---well">Time-independent Schrodinger equation - well</h3>
<p>For 1D- infinite well of width <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, we have following form of the potential. <span class="math display">\[
V =     
    \begin{cases}
       \infty,&amp; \text{if } |x|&gt; L/2 \\
        0,              &amp; \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\]</span> The equation inside the well is simply the Helmholtz equation we solved before. <span class="math display">\[
\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\psi(x) + \frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}\psi(x) = 0
\]</span> The eigenvalues of this system is <span class="math display">\[
E_n = \frac{\hbar^2 k_n^2}{2m}= \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2 n^2}{2mL^2}, \quad n = 1,2,3, ...
\]</span> with corresponding eigenfunctions. <span class="math display">\[
\psi_n (x)= 
\begin{cases}
   \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}}\cos(k_n x), &amp; n = 1,3,5,... \\
   \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}}\sin(k_n x), &amp; n = 2,4,6,...
\end{cases}
\]</span> One of the key point here is that the energy eigenvalue has quadratic dependence on the wave vector, <span class="math inline">\(k_n\)</span> as for the classical free-space energy (<span class="math inline">\(E = p^2/2m=(\hbar k)^2/2m\)</span>). We can imagine is that by increasing the system size, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> to infinity than the eigenvalue becomes continuum (spacing between the eigenvalue vanishes). Now, we bravely call an eigenstate that has (almost) vanishing energy as a “unbound” state.</p>
<p>One can recall the spectrum of the hydrogen. The eigenenergy scales as <span class="math inline">\(-1/n^2\)</span> and the spacing between the nearby energy level vanishes as <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> or the energy grows.</p>
<h3 id="solving-eigenvalue-problem-with-comsol">Solving eigenvalue problem with COMSOL</h3>
<p>To solve the eigelvalue problem in COMSOL, we use <code>Coefficient form PDE</code> and <code>Eigenvalue</code> study.</p>
<p>We set the Schrodinger equation in the nodes shown in the following figure.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The names on the coefficients is for general partial differential equations. You can find more information about the meaning of those names by just googling heat equation, diffusion equation and so on. We only set <code>c</code>=1 and <code>d_e</code> = 1 in this case since we only focus on the qualitative feature of the problem.</p>
<p>After solving the eigenvalue problem, we plot the eigenvalues with <code>Point graph</code>.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>We see quadratic scaling of the eigenvalues (<span class="math inline">\(\propto n^2 \propto k_n^2\)</span>) .</p>
<h3 id="bound-state-unbound-state">Bound state, unbound state</h3>
<p>We can glance some difference between the bound state and the (quasi-) unbound state. We can draw a potential of the following form by setting two <code>Coefficient form PDE</code> setting with different value of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, the absorption coefficient.<br />
<span class="math display">\[
a =     
    \begin{cases}
       \infty,&amp; \text{if } |x|&gt; 5\text{ m} \\
       500, &amp; \text{if} |x|&gt; 0.5\text{ m} \\
        0,              &amp; \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\]</span> The potential would looks like this.</p>

</figure>
<p>The spectrum of this system looks as follows. We see two groups of eigenvalues. The scaling is suddenly changed after eigenvalue reaches 500 when the particle is now free to move above the central well.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>If we zoom-in, we observe that the last boundstate is the solution number 9.</p>
<figure>
<img src="imgs/quadraticEigenvalues%20boud%20state%20zoomed.png" alt="Zoom-in" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Zoom-in</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let’s take a look at the shape of the wavefunction. First three lowest eigenfunctions (blue-green-red) are looks like this.</p>
<figure>
<img src="imgs/boundstatewavefunction.png" alt="First three lowest bound states" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">First three lowest bound states</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We see that the wavefunction is localized in the well and resembles the infinite well excepts the boundary that decays exponentially. As the energy increases the number of node also increases.</p>
<p>What about in the vicinity of the threshold (500)? The eigenfunction of 9, 10, 11 (blue, red, green) is shown here.</p>
<figure>
<img src="imgs/unboundstatewavefunction.png" alt="Wavefunctions near the threshold" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Wavefunctions near the threshold</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As we see, only # 9 is localized at the central well. 9 and 10 has very small energy difference but the shape of the wavefunction is quite different.</p>
<h3 id="homework-1">Homework 1</h3>
<p>Let us suppose that we weaken the well depth more and more. Is there any way to eliminate the bound state? If you think you find a bound state, than extend the domain size from 5 to say 100. Can you see the difference? There is no way to get rid of this bound state no matter how low the potential is. There is a theorem claim that there is at least one bound state in 1D quantum system. This theorem can be proved by yourself.</p>
<h3 id="double-well-and-the-degeneracy">Double well and the degeneracy</h3>
<p>We create double well as follows.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The spectrum looks a bit different. There are paired energy values.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<h3 id="homework-2">Homework 2</h3>
<p>Do eigenvalues start to degenerate? But we build a very symmetric potential but there still is some broken degeneracy. Can we make absolute degeneracy? Actually there is also a theorem saying there can not be a degenerate state in 1D quantum system. Try to prove it!. You can find the proof on many textbooks.</p>
<h2 id="d-simple-harmonic-oscillator-sho">1D Simple harmonic oscillator (SHO)</h2>
<p>Now we consider a simple harmonic oscillator of angular frequency, <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>. The energy eigenvalue is <span class="math display">\[
E_{n} = \hbar\omega(n+\frac{1}{2}), \quad n=0, 1, 2, ...
\]</span> SHO can be realize by inserting <code>1e4 [1/m^4]* x^2</code> in <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> We see that the eigenvalue is linearly scales with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="imgs/SHOeigenvalue.png" alt="SHO eigenvalue" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">SHO eigenvalue</figcaption>

<p>First three eigenstates are Hermite-gaussian functions.</p>
<figure>
<img src="imgs/SHOwavefunction.png" alt="SHO wavefunction" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">SHO wavefunction</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Notice that one should use strong enough spring constant (so I put <code>1e4</code>) to localize the wavefunction. If this is not strong enough, the boundary condition (infinite well) is more dominant than the harmonic potential, resulting in more like a previous case.</p>
<h2 id="d-sho">2D SHO</h2>
<p>We can extend the system to 2D by just starting a new simulation with 2D domain setting. <span class="math display">\[
E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar\omega(n_x+n_y+1)
\]</span> We give a circle of radius 1m and gives strong enough potential as before. One can observe the exact degeneracy in this case.</p>
<figure>

<p>Here is first 3 wavefunctions. Last two are energetically degenerate (just rotated!).</p>

<h2 id="time-dependent-schrodinger-equation">Time-dependent Schrodinger equation</h2>
<p>Steady state gives us many useful information, however, it does not tell us how a wave packet moves after launched to some velocity. We solve time dependent Schrodinger equation with a Gaussian shaped wave packet.</p>
<p>We can solve the dynamics with choosing <code>time dependnent</code> study and modify the coefficients to have Schrodinger equation. Now the variable, <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is a complex number.</p>
<p>We are going to use a wavefunction of the following shape. (Forget about the normalization for a moment) <span class="math inline">\(\psi (x) = \exp\left[ -\frac{x^2}{4\sigma^2} \right]\)</span></p>
<p>First we try to find out how a Gaussian wavepacket without net momentum spreading in the well. At the end, it is reflected from the boundary of the well, (I impose Dirichelet Boundary) shattered into some uniform shape. Notice that it is easy for simulation to blow up since the spatial frequency becomes very high after the reflection.</p>
<figure>
<img src="imgs/schrodinger-gaussianspreading.gif" alt="Spreading Gaussian in a well" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Spreading Gaussian in a well</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One can calculate how does wavepacket spread over time without any potential (infinite space, no boundary like the simulation). <span class="math display">\[
\sigma(t) = \sigma(0) \sqrt{1+ \left(\frac{t}{\tau}\right)^2}, \quad \text{where } \tau = 2m\sigma^2/\hbar
\]</span> Notice that the it takes more time to spread when the mass or the initial uncertainty (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>) is larger.</p>
<p>If there is a harmonic potential, we expect it not to spread anymore. Let us impose a harmonic potential.</p>
<figure>
<img src="imgs/schrodinger-gaussianinharmonic2.gif" alt="Spreading Gaussian packet in SHO" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Spreading Gaussian packet in SHO</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The width of the packet oscillates over time because it not close to the eigenstate. Here we showed that when the width of the initial packet is smaller than the eigenstate value. Following animation is when the initial state is larger than the eigenstate value. We see that the packet is compressed in the beginning.</p>
<figure>
<img src="imgs/schrodinger-gaussianinharmonic.gif" alt="Compressing Gaussian packet in SHO" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Compressing Gaussian packet in SHO</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If one get closer to the eigenvalue, it barely oscillates showing the meaning of the ‘steady state’.</p>
<figure>
<img src="imgs/schrodinger-gaussianinharmonic3.gif" alt="Steady Gaussian packet in SHO" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Steady Gaussian packet in SHO</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let us give a kick to the Gaussian packet. Giving a momentum kick can be done naively by just imposing a phase factor, <span class="math inline">\(e^{imvx}\)</span> to the wavefunction. Give <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\partial u / \partial t\)</span> initial condition for now. Note that this is not exact way to launch the Gaussian packet in free space but considering this as an attempt. In a well, it spreads while moving, reflects at the boundary.</p>
<figure>
<img src="imgs/schrodinger-kickedgaussianinwell.gif" alt="Kicked packet in a well" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Kicked packet in a well</figcaption>

<p>With the harmonic potential, it oscillates over time while maintaining its width.</p>

<h2 id="tunneling-dynamics">Tunneling dynamics</h2>
<p>We are now able to launch a wavepacket and can build a finite potential well. As the last task, we try to simulate an interesting phenomena, the tunneling. In order to do simulate properly we need to learn how to set initial <span class="math inline">\(\partial u/\partial t\)</span>. The initial time derivative information is very important. There are many resources on this such as textbook or internet. Here is a nice <a href="https://www.reed.edu/physics/faculty/wheeler/documents/Quantum%20Mechanics/Miscellaneous%20Essays/Gaussian%20Wavepackets.pdf">lecture note from professor N. Wheeler</a>. Once you type a proper boundary condition, you will get following launched packet.</p>
<figure>
<img src="imgs/nobarrier.gif" alt="Launched Gaussian packet" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Launched Gaussian packet</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now we build a finite potential near 0. The potential I used here looks like this.</p>
<figure>
<img src="imgs/d780607a76c8ff2c67026c33fdd1c74c.png" alt="Potential barrier" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Potential barrier</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We observe a tunneling through the barrier. The potential barrier is high enough (Potential is 50% higher than the kinetic energy). We observe that large part of the wavepacket is been transmitted. When the pulse arrives the barrier it shows strong peaking behavior due to the interference between input pulse and the reflected pulse.</p>
<figure>
<img src="imgs/tunneling.gif" alt="Tunneling" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Tunneling</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When the potential is shallower than the kinetic energy (kinetic energy is twice the potential barrier in this case) , it shows a bit different intermediate transients but still there is small reflection.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>What happen if the potential has negative value? How does transient region changes? Does packet always transmitted through the attractive potential?</li>
<li>In classical penetration regime, does transmission increase when the height of the potential decrease always? This questions are related to the resonance phenomena.</li>
